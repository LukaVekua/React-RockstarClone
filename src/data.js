He’s also been working on a plan called Project Overthrow — a multipronged attack on Merryweather Security to knock them well and truly off their perch.
        The way Charlie sees it, Merryweather have amassed enough defense contracts, illegal R&D, and good old-fashioned criminal rackets that ripping them off in a series of high-flying schemes is a win-win scenario for him and your smuggling operation. Project Overthrow features six new missions for 1–4 players that will put your mercenary skills to the ultimate test: conducting reconnaissance, recovering valuable equipment, performing audacious rescues, and fighting your way through the teeth of Merryweather’s well-oiled war machine.                   
        Project Overthrow is launched from the new Operations Terminal upgrade for the Mammoth Avenger, available at Warstock Cache & Carry.`,
